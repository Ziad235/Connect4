# Connect4
### A Python program based on the classic game of "Connect 4."
The variation here is that the dimension of the "board" can be decided by the user, and the game can allow up to 5 distinct players.  
The rules of the game are the same as those of the regular "Connect 4" game.  

#### How to run the program:
- Make sure Python3 is installed.
- Run the program on the terminal using "python3 <program_name>.py".
