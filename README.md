# Connect4
This a program coded in Python3 that is based on the game "Connect 4."\n
The variation here is that the dimension of the "board" can be decided by the user, and the game can allow up to 5 distinct players.\n
The rules of the game are the same as those of the regular "Connect 4" game.\n
To run the program, type the following in the terminal's command line once you're in the desired directory: python3 Connect4.py\n
